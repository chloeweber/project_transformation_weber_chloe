##Comments

I really enjoyed working on this assignment! Responsive desgin is one of the top subjects I wanted to learn this semester, and it is exciting that we now have the foundation to do so. I want to make my personal website responsive now!

The clearfix and the adjacent sibling selector were very useful this project. I used the clearfix on multiple occasions since I was able to see what the floats were doing to my site using the dev tools. I used the adjacent sibling selector on the banner shadow to push it up to the banner. With the responsive elements I added to the CSS, the shadow image wasn't showing up. I hacked this a little by placeing it in the HTML under the banner and pushing it up using the above method. Not sure if this is acceptable, but I do think I was clever for using it.
